The present study aims to evaluate the foods that cause immediatetype hypersensitivity in Sri Lanka, and to compare with Asia and the developed west.\\nMethods: Records of patients referred to an Immunology clinic from 2010 –January 2022 were\\nreviewed. The diagnosis of food allergy was based on standard guidelines. Con ﬁrmation of the\\nspeci ﬁc food implicated was based on the history and the presence of speci ﬁc IgE or component\\nresolved diagnostics by in vitro methods (Phadia ImmunoCap) or by skin prick testing with com-\\nmercial extracts (Alk Abello).

IgE mediated\\nfood allergy may give rise to cutaneous (urticaria,angioedema), gastro intestinal (vomiting,\\ndiarrhoea and abdominal pain), cardiovascular\\n(hypotension), and respiratory (oral allergy\\nsyndrome, stridor, wheeze, cough) symptoms and\\nsigns. Some of these patients will have anaphylaxis.\\nCow ’s milk (CM), egg, wheat, soy, peanut, tree nut,\\nﬁsh, and shell ﬁsh are responsible for 90% of food\\nallergy in the west;\\n2however, local dietary habits\\nmay result in speci ﬁc allergies, for example,\\nsesame in Israel and buckwheat in Japan.3\\nIn East and Central Asian countries, the food\\ntriggers for severe allergic reactions are major\\ncomponents of the Asian diet: ﬁsh, shell ﬁsh, bird ’s\\nnest, buckwheat, and royal jelly.4In Singapore,\\nThailand, and Hong Kong, shell ﬁsh is one of the\\nmost important food triggers of anaphylaxis inadults and children. Allergy to edible bird ’s nest\\nfrom swiftlets has also been described in\\nSingapore and Malaysia.\\n4\\nData on food allergies in South Asia are scarce.\\nIn the EuroPrevall-INCO study conducted in 8countries, the incidence of food allergy in adults in\\nIndia was 1.3% with CM and apple being the\\ncommonest food allergens.\\n5A meta-analysis\\nshowed the food allergens identi ﬁed in India;\\nApple, ﬁsh, banana, cow ’s milk, melon, sesame,\\nshrimp, tree nuts, chickpea, capsicum, Indian len-\\ntils, avocado, banana, beef, bulgur wheat, coconut,\\ncorn, eggplant, garlic, ginger, green peas, jala-\\npeño peppers, kiwi, melon, rice, and tomato.6In\\naddition, there are a few case reports of allergy\\nto mango, mushroom, fenugreek, and chickpea.5\\nThe data from Sri Lanka is meagre. Using a\\nquestionnaire in 449 school children in the\\nColombo District, 30% of the respondents\\nbelieved they had a food allergy, of which pine-\\napple was thought to be the commonest allergicfood. In addition, rambutan ( Nepheliumlappaceum ), tomato, bread fruit ( Artocarpus altilis ),\\nprawns, cuttle ﬁsh, tuna, and canned ﬁsh were\\nimplicated.\\n7However, con ﬁrmatory tests were not\\nperformed.\\nAnaphylaxis is the most dangerous allergic\\nmanifestation. In a global review on food-based\\nanaphylaxis,8the commonest foods implicated\\nwere peanut, sesame, eggs, CM, celery, lupin, tree\\nnuts, wheat, crustaceans, mollusks, ﬁsh, soy, and\\nfruits. Other animal foods were also implicated.\\nHowever, in Sri Lanka, CM (26%), eggs (2%),\\nsesame (2%), spices other than sesame (2%),\\nwheat (3%), crustaceans (4%), mollusks (1%), and\\nﬁsh (2%) were responsible for anaphylaxis.9\\nAnaphylaxis to red meats were seen in 40% of\\npatients in Sri Lanka, much more than in othercountries.\\nTwo novel food allergies have been identi ﬁed in\\nthe past 2 decades, both leading to anaphylaxis.Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis\\n(FDEIA) occurs when physical exertion follows\\ningestion of the implicated food, generally within\\n4 hours. While many foods have been implicated,\\nwheat is responsible for FDEIA in Sri Lanka.\\n10\\nAlpha gal allergy is responsible for allergy to redmeats. A tick bite sensitizes a patient to a\\ncarbohydrate moiety (alpha gal), which is present\\nin the saliva of ticks and in non-primate mam-\\nmals.\\n11Ingestion of red meat leads to delayed\\nanaphylaxis (up to 7 hours after ingestion). Whilethis condition has not been reported so far in Sri\\nLanka, we have identi ﬁed a number of such\\npersons.\\nThe present study aims to evaluate the foods\\nthat cause immediate type hypersensitivity, and to\\ncompare with data from Asia and the west.\\nMETHODS\\nOur immunology clinic in Sri Lanka caters to pa-\\ntients from the entire country.

The diagnostic\\ncriteria included one of 3 clinical scenarios; namely,\\n(1) acute onset of skin manifestations associated\\nwith respiratory or cardiovascular signs or symp-\\ntoms, (2) involvement of at least 2 systems (skin,\\nrespiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal) that\\noccurred rapidly after exposure to a likely allergenfor that patient, or (3) reduced blood pressure after\\nexposure to a known allergen for that patient.\\n12The\\ndiagnosis of food allergy was based on standard\\nguidelines.12Patients with a history of food allergy\\nwithin 2 hours of ingestion were selected.

Where commercial extracts or in vitro\\ndiagnostics were not available, as for example,\\nfruits and vegetables, prick to prick testing was\\nperformed.

Patients with positive results were\\nanalyzed with component resolved diagnostics,\\nincluding IgE to Bos d 6 (bovine serum albumin,\\nBSA) and bovine gelatin.\\nFDEIA was identi ﬁed when symptoms and signs\\nof allergy, including anaphylaxis, occurred during\\nor within an hour of exercise, preceded by ingestion\\nof food (for up to 4 hours), or by ingestion immedi-\\nately after exertion.\\n15People who developed\\nallergy to the food in the absence of exertion, or\\nwith exercise unaccompanied by ingestion of the\\nfood, were excluded.

The reason for the high prevalence is\\npossibly because many clinicians were unaware of\\nthe condition and referred such patients to our\\nclinic. Wheat was the only food identi ﬁed. While\\nwheat is the commonest allergen, other foods are\\nalso implicated elsewhere.\\n10\\nRed meat was the commonest allergen in the 5 –\\n12-year age group, and was the second most\\ncommon in adults. In addition, patients with red\\nmeat allergy developed allergic reactionsincluding anaphylaxis, to vaccines containing\\nbovine/porcine components such as the measles,\\nmumps, and rubella (MMR) and the live Japanese\\nencephalitis (JE) vaccine. Allergy to bovine/\\nporcine excipients have been implicated in allergic\\nreactions to these vaccines.\\n48Patients with CMA48\\nor red meat allergy49may be at risk and therefore\\ncaution should be exercised when administering\\nsuch vaccines. Gelatin or BSA49has been\\nimplicated as the culprit allergen. JE is a single\\ndose vaccine, and most MMR reactions occurred\\nwith the second dose;49the need for further\\nvaccines did not arise in a majority of these\\npatients. Unfortunately, vaccines free of bovine\\nexcipients are not available in Sri Lanka. Patients\\nwith alpha-gal allergy were not at risk of vaccine\\nallergy, possibly due to its onset being after the\\nage of immunization with these vaccines.\\nCow ’s milk was the most common cause of\\nanaphylaxis in children below 5 years, as in othercountries. Coconut was the second commonestcause of anaphylaxis in infancy. Coconut is part of\\nthe daily diet of a majority of Sri Lankans, and is a\\nweaning food. Although data regarding coconut\\n(Cocos nucifera ) allergy is limited, a recent\\nAustralian paediatric case series reported 35 pa-\\ntients with allergy to coconut including 9 with\\nanaphylaxis.\\n50Anaphylaxis to hen ’s egg was\\nuncommon, contrasting with data from Europe,51\\nChina, Japan, Korea, and Singapore.52\\nAnaphylaxis to nuts and peanuts was uncommon\\nsimilar to South Asia, but is relatively common in\\nHong Kong, Singapore, and in Europe and\\nAustralia.8\\nAnaphylaxis to fruits was also very rare in our\\npopulation. This contrasts with the rest of the\\nworld, where it is common.8Anaphylaxis due to\\ningestion of horse purslane ( Trianthema\\nportulacastrum ), locally known as \"Sarana\", was\\nidenti ﬁed in 1 patient. This has not been\\nreported previously.\\nPollen food allergy syndrome\\nNo patient had pollen food allergy syndrome\\n(PFAS).There are case reports of PFAS from India,53\\nbut they are rare compared to the west. The reasonfor this discrepancy is unclear.\\nThe present study was limited to patients\\nreferred from other centers for evaluation of food\\nallergy.
