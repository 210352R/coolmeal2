IgE mediated\\nfood allergy may give rise to cutaneous (urticaria,angioedema), gastro intestinal (vomiting,\\ndiarrhoea and abdominal pain), cardiovascular\\n(hypotension), and respiratory (oral allergy\\nsyndrome, stridor, wheeze, cough) symptoms and\\nsigns. Some of these patients will have anaphylaxis.\\nCow ’s milk (CM), egg, wheat, soy, peanut, tree nut,\\nﬁsh, and shell ﬁsh are responsible for 90% of food\\nallergy in the west;\\n2however, local dietary habits\\nmay result in speci ﬁc allergies, for example,\\nsesame in Israel and buckwheat in Japan.3\\nIn East and Central Asian countries, the food\\ntriggers for severe allergic reactions are major\\ncomponents of the Asian diet: ﬁsh, shell ﬁsh, bird ’s\\nnest, buckwheat, and royal jelly.4In Singapore,\\nThailand, and Hong Kong, shell ﬁsh is one of the\\nmost important food triggers of anaphylaxis inadults and children. Allergy to edible bird ’s nest\\nfrom swiftlets has also been described in\\nSingapore and Malaysia.\\n4\\nData on food allergies in South Asia are scarce.\\nIn the EuroPrevall-INCO study conducted in 8countries, the incidence of food allergy in adults in\\nIndia was 1.3% with CM and apple being the\\ncommonest food allergens.\\n5A meta-analysis\\nshowed the food allergens identi ﬁed in India;\\nApple, ﬁsh, banana, cow ’s milk, melon, sesame,\\nshrimp, tree nuts, chickpea, capsicum, Indian len-\\ntils, avocado, banana, beef, bulgur wheat, coconut,\\ncorn, eggplant, garlic, ginger, green peas, jala-\\npeño peppers, kiwi, melon, rice, and tomato.6In\\naddition, there are a few case reports of allergy\\nto mango, mushroom, fenugreek, and chickpea.5\\nThe data from Sri Lanka is meagre. Using a\\nquestionnaire in 449 school children in the\\nColombo District, 30% of the respondents\\nbelieved they had a food allergy, of which pine-\\napple was thought to be the commonest allergicfood. In addition, rambutan ( Nepheliumlappaceum ), tomato, bread fruit ( Artocarpus altilis ),\\nprawns, cuttle ﬁsh, tuna, and canned ﬁsh were\\nimplicated.\\n7However, con ﬁrmatory tests were not\\nperformed.\\nAnaphylaxis is the most dangerous allergic\\nmanifestation. In a global review on food-based\\nanaphylaxis,8the commonest foods implicated\\nwere peanut, sesame, eggs, CM, celery, lupin, tree\\nnuts, wheat, crustaceans, mollusks, ﬁsh, soy, and\\nfruits. Other animal foods were also implicated.\\nHowever, in Sri Lanka, CM (26%), eggs (2%),\\nsesame (2%), spices other than sesame (2%),\\nwheat (3%), crustaceans (4%), mollusks (1%), and\\nﬁsh (2%) were responsible for anaphylaxis.9\\nAnaphylaxis to red meats were seen in 40% of\\npatients in Sri Lanka, much more than in othercountries.\\nTwo novel food allergies have been identi ﬁed in\\nthe past 2 decades, both leading to anaphylaxis.Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis\\n(FDEIA) occurs when physical exertion follows\\ningestion of the implicated food, generally within\\n4 hours. While many foods have been implicated,\\nwheat is responsible for FDEIA in Sri Lanka.\\n10\\nAlpha gal allergy is responsible for allergy to redmeats. A tick bite sensitizes a patient to a\\ncarbohydrate moiety (alpha gal), which is present\\nin the saliva of ticks and in non-primate mam-\\nmals.\\n11Ingestion of red meat leads to delayed\\nanaphylaxis (up to 7 hours after ingestion). Whilethis condition has not been reported so far in Sri\\nLanka, we have identi ﬁed a number of such\\npersons.\\nThe present study aims to evaluate the foods\\nthat cause immediate type hypersensitivity, and to\\ncompare with data from Asia and the west.\\nMETHODS\\nOur immunology clinic in Sri Lanka caters to pa-\\ntients from the entire country.

The reason for the high prevalence is\\npossibly because many clinicians were unaware of\\nthe condition and referred such patients to our\\nclinic. Wheat was the only food identi ﬁed. While\\nwheat is the commonest allergen, other foods are\\nalso implicated elsewhere.\\n10\\nRed meat was the commonest allergen in the 5 –\\n12-year age group, and was the second most\\ncommon in adults. In addition, patients with red\\nmeat allergy developed allergic reactionsincluding anaphylaxis, to vaccines containing\\nbovine/porcine components such as the measles,\\nmumps, and rubella (MMR) and the live Japanese\\nencephalitis (JE) vaccine. Allergy to bovine/\\nporcine excipients have been implicated in allergic\\nreactions to these vaccines.\\n48Patients with CMA48\\nor red meat allergy49may be at risk and therefore\\ncaution should be exercised when administering\\nsuch vaccines. Gelatin or BSA49has been\\nimplicated as the culprit allergen. JE is a single\\ndose vaccine, and most MMR reactions occurred\\nwith the second dose;49the need for further\\nvaccines did not arise in a majority of these\\npatients. Unfortunately, vaccines free of bovine\\nexcipients are not available in Sri Lanka. Patients\\nwith alpha-gal allergy were not at risk of vaccine\\nallergy, possibly due to its onset being after the\\nage of immunization with these vaccines.\\nCow ’s milk was the most common cause of\\nanaphylaxis in children below 5 years, as in othercountries. Coconut was the second commonestcause of anaphylaxis in infancy. Coconut is part of\\nthe daily diet of a majority of Sri Lankans, and is a\\nweaning food. Although data regarding coconut\\n(Cocos nucifera ) allergy is limited, a recent\\nAustralian paediatric case series reported 35 pa-\\ntients with allergy to coconut including 9 with\\nanaphylaxis.\\n50Anaphylaxis to hen ’s egg was\\nuncommon, contrasting with data from Europe,51\\nChina, Japan, Korea, and Singapore.52\\nAnaphylaxis to nuts and peanuts was uncommon\\nsimilar to South Asia, but is relatively common in\\nHong Kong, Singapore, and in Europe and\\nAustralia.8\\nAnaphylaxis to fruits was also very rare in our\\npopulation. This contrasts with the rest of the\\nworld, where it is common.8Anaphylaxis due to\\ningestion of horse purslane ( Trianthema\\nportulacastrum ), locally known as \"Sarana\", was\\nidenti ﬁed in 1 patient. This has not been\\nreported previously.\\nPollen food allergy syndrome\\nNo patient had pollen food allergy syndrome\\n(PFAS).There are case reports of PFAS from India,53\\nbut they are rare compared to the west. The reasonfor this discrepancy is unclear.\\nThe present study was limited to patients\\nreferred from other centers for evaluation of food\\nallergy. Some patients in whom the implicated\\nfood was easily identi ﬁed may not have been\\nreferred to our unit, even though this may be a\\nsmall number as our clinic is the only unit in thecountry offering diagnostic services, free of\\ncharge.

It was   conducted successfully with the immense support of chef guild’s       association and other stake holders. The rising trend of non-communicable diseases like hypertension and heart disease is mainly due to salt consumption. It is estimated that a Sri Lankan consumes up to 8-18 g of salt/day. The WHO has recommended only 1 tsp (5g) of salt per person in a day therefore, people in our country should reduce the consumption of salt by 15%.\\nThe main component that affects health is the amount of sodium that is present \\nin the salt. A normal adult needs only 1 g of sodium during the day. Half a             teaspoon of salt contains 1g of salt. If a person who consumes 12 g of salt can reduce it up to 10 g then the risk of hypertension can be reduced by 40%.\\nIt is seen that with increasing age and high salt consumption there’s an increased \\nincidence of hypertension. The most vulnerable age group is between 30-50 years. Therefore, it is our responsibility to make awareness among the public and educate them.\\nThe book consists of recipes created by our participants and the nutritional value \\nwith the amount of salt added is speciﬁed in each recipe. I hope that this would be an innovative and useful resource.\\nI greatly appreciate the support given by the stakeholders who contributed to \\nmake this event a success. The book is the ultimate outcome of the event. I hope this book will help us to make a change in the community.\\nDr. Renuka Jayatissa,President,Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association.'),\n",

Consuming more than 5 grams of salt per day contributes to high blood pressure and increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. \\nThe World Health Organization guides Member States with a ‘menu’ of policy \\noptions to achieve noncommunicable disease (NCD) targets by 2025. Reduced population intake of salt is essential to meet the overall SDG3 goal of 25%              reduction in premature mortality from NCDs. Dietary surveys have shown that the average salt intake in Sri Lanka is nearly double the recommended 5  grams per day, mainly contributed by dietary practices of adding salt to rice and consuming  traditionally preserved salty foods.    In this backdrop, the World Health Organization is pleased to collaborate with the Sri Lanka Medical Nutritionists Association and the Directorate of NCD,        Ministry of Health to conduct the ‘National Low Salt Cooking Challenge’ to engage those involved in food technology, culinary science and public to              innovate in cooking low salt popular Sri Lankan dishes. With the Chefs Guild of Sri Lanka, selected recipes from this successful event are compiled, published and made available to general public.  \\nWe look forward to continuing the multi-sectoral partnerships in Sri Lanka to   \\nsupport the country achieve its targets in prevention and control of NCDs towards health and well-being of its population. \\nDr. Alaka SinghWHO Country Representative for Sri Lanka'),\n",

Heart disease and stroke are also identiﬁed as the leading causes of death and disability in Sri Lanka, and high blood pressure is identiﬁed as an important      modiﬁable risk factor for both these disease conditions. It is further proven that excess dietary intake of salt (sodium) is a leading cause of high blood pressure. Therefore, it is necessary that action is taken to strengthen community awareness on the importance of reducing salt consumption for good health.\\nIn this regard, the Directorate of Non-Communicable Disease of the Ministry of \\nHealth, in close collaboration with the Sri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association (SLMNA) and the World Health Organization – Sri Lanka Country Office,              conducted and successfully completed the “Low Salt Cooking Challenge”       competition among the general public. The main objective of this competition was to promote the reduction in the use of salt during cooking and preparation of meals, and also to generate a book of low salt recipes. This book of recipes will be invaluable in the community empowerment towards promotion of low salt consumption, for the long-term outcome of reducing the incidence of high blood pressure.\\nI take this opportunity as the Ministry of Health, to convey our appreciation to the \\nSri Lanka Medical Nutrition Association (SLMNA), the World Health  Organization – Sri Lanka Country Office, the Chef’s Guild of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Spices Board, for the immense contribution they have made towards making this           objective a big success. \\nDr. Vindya KumarapeliConsultant Community PhysicianDirector- Non Communicable DiseasesMinistry of Health'),\n",

High sodium intake increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. And may as well have other harmful effects including increased risk of stroke, heart failure, osteoporosis, obesity, gastric cancer, and chronic kidney disease. Therefore, the WHO has acknowledged high sodium intake as one of the silent killers of humans and has recommended to reduce sodium to less than 2000 mg/day (5 g/day salt) in adults. According to the National Population Salt      Consumption survey in 2012, we Sri Lankans consume two times higher than the recommended.\\nNearly 80% of the salt in our diet comes from home cooked foods.
